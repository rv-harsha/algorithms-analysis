# Analysis of Image Processing Algorithms 

## Introduction

Image processing constitutes a great share of the computational workload of current times, and with the availability of parallel processing hardware we aim to find the performance benefits of using these resources.With this project we plan to parallelize Median Filtering, Edge Detection and Image Thresholding, three very common algorithms used in image processing using OpenMP and analyze their relative performance comparing Multi-CPU and GPU implementations on AWS Cloud instances.
